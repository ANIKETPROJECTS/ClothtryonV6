**PROMPT FOR REPLIT:**

Create a premium single-page virtual try-on web application for ONYU brand t-shirts with the following specifications:

## Core Features:

1. **Landing Page:**
   - Modern, high-end UI design with smooth animations
   - Brand name "ONYU" prominently displayed in the header with elegant logo/typography
   - Hero section showcasing a single t-shirt product
   - Large, high-quality product images with zoom capability
   - Product details (name, price, description, size chart)
   - Prominent "Try Virtual Try-On" button with engaging hover effects
   - Responsive design that works flawlessly on mobile and desktop
   - Footer with ONYU branding

2. **Virtual Try-On Camera System:**
   - Opens full-screen camera view on both mobile and desktop
   - Implements real-time body pose detection using TensorFlow.js with PoseNet or MoveNet model
   - Tracks 17+ body keypoints for accurate t-shirt placement
   - Overlays t-shirt image that follows body movement in real-time
   - Shows 4 different t-shirt views based on body orientation:
     * Front view (when facing camera)
     * Left side view (when body turns left)
     * Right side view (when body turns right)
     * Back view (when facing away - detected by pose estimation)

3. **Real-time Metrics Display:**
   - Accuracy indicator showing pose detection confidence (0-100%)
   - Size estimation based on body proportions (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
   - Visual indicators for proper positioning
   - FPS counter for performance monitoring
   - All metrics displayed with clean, minimal UI that doesn't obstruct the view

4. **T-shirt Image Handling:**
   - Support for 4 images per t-shirt (front, back, left side, right side)
   - Smart orientation detection to switch between views seamlessly
   - Proper scaling and perspective transformation to match body dimensions
   - Smooth transitions between different views (use interpolation for natural feel)

## Technical Requirements:

- Use vanilla JavaScript or React for the frontend
- Integrate TensorFlow.js with MoveNet (Thunder or Lightning) for accurate body tracking
- Use MediaPipe Pose as an alternative for maximum accuracy
- Implement canvas rendering for t-shirt overlay
- Ensure camera access works on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Add proper error handling for camera permissions and device compatibility
- Optimize for consistent 30+ FPS performance
- Make it work offline-capable with service workers if possible

## UI/UX Design Guidelines:

**Branding:**
- Use "ONYU" as the brand name throughout
- Create a sophisticated, memorable logo treatment for ONYU
- Suggest a premium color palette (e.g., black/charcoal with gold/bronze accents, or minimalist monochrome)

**Design Style:**
- Modern, clean aesthetic with generous white space
- Implement micro-interactions and buttery-smooth transitions
- Use glassmorphism or subtle gradients for depth
- Add loading states with branded skeleton screens
- Include intuitive gesture controls (pinch to zoom, swipe)
- Show helpful onboarding tooltips for first-time users
- Add "Capture Photo" button to save the virtual try-on result with ONYU watermark
- Include "Exit Try-On" button to return to product page
- Make controls minimalistic and non-intrusive during try-on
- Typography should feel premium (suggest: Inter, Sora, or similar modern sans-serif)

## Image Configuration:

Create a configuration system where I can easily replace the 4 t-shirt images:
```javascript
const tshirtImages = {
  front: 'path/to/front.png',
  back: 'path/to/back.png',
  left: 'path/to/left-side.png',
  right: 'path/to/right-side.png'
};
```

Include clear instructions in comments on image requirements (resolution, format, transparency).

## Additional Features:

- Add calibration step to improve size accuracy (ask user to stand at arm's length)
- Show silhouette guide to help users position correctly
- Display body measurements estimation in real-time
- Include "How it works" modal explaining the ONYU virtual try-on technology
- Add social sharing capability for captured photos with ONYU branding
- Include accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add "Share your look" feature with Instagram/Twitter integration

## Performance Optimization:

- Lazy load the ML models only when try-on is activated
- Show engaging loading animation with ONYU branding while model loads
- Compress and optimize t-shirt images (use WebP with PNG fallback)
- Use Web Workers for pose detection to keep UI thread responsive
- Implement proper memory management to prevent leaks
- Add fallback UI for devices that don't support required features
- Cache models locally after first load

## Error Handling:

- Graceful camera permission denial handling
- Device compatibility checks with helpful messages
- Network error handling for model loading
- Low-light detection with suggestions to improve lighting

Please create a fully functional, production-ready application with clean, well-documented code. The design should be Instagram-worthy with attention to every detail - typography, spacing, colors, and animations should all feel premium and polished, befitting the ONYU brand identity.

The overall vibe should be: **cutting-edge technology meets luxury fashion.**
